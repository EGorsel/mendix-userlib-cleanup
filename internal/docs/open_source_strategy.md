# Security & Community standards update plan
To make this project truly community-driven, we should:
1. Add a **Code of Conduct**.
2. Standardize the **Contribution Guidelines** (CONTRIBUTING.md).
3. Add a **Security Policy** (SECURITY.md) - already done but can be refined.
4. Improve the **README.md** with:
    - Shields.io badges.
    - Simplified Quick Start.
    - A visual Mermaid flow.
    - A community-first support section.
